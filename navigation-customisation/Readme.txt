This folder contains the changes to Twonky navigation and the order that files are presented.


the userview-E....xml file is a user tree that is very quick and easy to recreate in the 
TwonkyUI.

The views-definition.patch file is documented in views-patch.sh. The patch can be applied, 
tested, and reverted if necessary by running the views-patch.sh script.
